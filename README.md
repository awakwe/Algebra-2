# Algebra 2 


## Unit 8: EXPONENTS AND RADICALS

Simplify the expressions using exponent rules.

1. $b^4 \cdot b^3$
   
   **Solution:** When multiplying expressions with the same base, we add the exponents. So, $b^4 \cdot b^3 = b^{4+3} = b^7$.

2. $c^5 \cdot c^2 \cdot c^2$
   
   **Solution:** Similarly, for this expression, we add all the exponents: $c^5 \cdot c^2 \cdot c^2 = c^{5+2+2} = c^9$.

3. $a^{-4} \cdot a^{-3}$
   
   **Solution:** The rule of adding exponents applies here as well. Negative exponents indicate that the base is on the denominator of a fraction. However, for this problem, we just add the exponents: $a^{-4} \cdot a^{-3} = a^{-4-3} = a^{-7}$.

4. $x^5 \cdot x^{-4} \cdot x$
   
   **Solution:** In this case, we add the exponents, and remember that $x$ is the same as $x^1$. So, $x^5 \cdot x^{-4} \cdot x = x^{5+(-4)+1} = x^2$.

5. $(2x)^2 \cdot (4y)^2$
   
   **Solution:** When raising a power to a power, we multiply the exponents. Also, remember that both the coefficient and the variable are raised to the power. So, $(2x)^2 \cdot (4y)^2 = (2^2x^2)(4^2y^2) = 4x^2 \cdot 16y^2 = 64x^2y^2$.

6. $-2gh \cdot (g^3h^5)$
   
   **Solution:** In this case, we multiply the like terms. So, $-2gh \cdot (g^3h^5) = -2g^1h^1 \cdot g^3h^5 = -2g^{1+3}h^{1+5} = -2g^4h^6$.

7. $10x^2y^3 \cdot (10xy^8)$
   
   **Solution:** Here, we multiply the coefficients and add the exponents of like terms. So, $10x^2y^3 \cdot (10xy^8) = 10 \cdot 10 \cdot x^{2+1}y^{3+8} = 100x^3y^{11}$.

## Quizzes

Throughout the module, there will be quizzes to test your knowledge on the topics we have covered. These quizzes will help you assess your understanding and identify areas where you may need to review.

## Active Learning Strategies

During the virtual lecture, we will use active learning strategies to engage with the material and deepen our understanding. These strategies may include group discussions, problem-solving activities, and interactive simulations.

## Conclusion

By the end of this module, you should have a strong foundation in Algebra 1 and be able to apply your knowledge to solve real-world problems.
