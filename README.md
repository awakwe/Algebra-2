# Algebra 2 


## Unit 8: EXPONENTS AND RADICALS

Simplify the expressions using exponent rules.

1. $b^4 \cdot b^3$
   
   **Solution:** When multiplying expressions with the same base, we add the exponents. So, $b^4 \cdot b^3 = b^{4+3} = b^7$.

2. $c^5 \cdot c^2 \cdot c^2$
   
   **Solution:** Similarly, for this expression, we add all the exponents: $c^5 \cdot c^2 \cdot c^2 = c^{5+2+2} = c^9$.

3. $a^{-4} \cdot a^{-3}$
   
   **Solution:** The rule of adding exponents applies here as well. Negative exponents indicate that the base is on the denominator of a fraction. However, for this problem, we just add the exponents: $a^{-4} \cdot a^{-3} = a^{-4-3} = a^{-7}$.

4. $x^5 \cdot x^{-4} \cdot x$
   
   **Solution:** In this case, we add the exponents, and remember that $x$ is the same as $x^1$. So, $x^5 \cdot x^{-4} \cdot x = x^{5+(-4)+1} = x^2$.

5. $(2x)^2 \cdot (4y)^2$
   
   **Solution:** When raising a power to a power, we multiply the exponents. Also, remember that both the coefficient and the variable are raised to the power. So, $(2x)^2 \cdot (4y)^2 = (2^2x^2)(4^2y^2) = 4x^2 \cdot 16y^2 = 64x^2y^2$.

6. $-2gh \cdot (g^3h^5)$
   
   **Solution:** In this case, we multiply the like terms. So, $-2gh \cdot (g^3h^5) = -2g^1h^1 \cdot g^3h^5 = -2g^{1+3}h^{1+5} = -2g^4h^6$.

7. $10x^2y^3 \cdot (10xy^8)$
   
   **Solution:** Here, we multiply the coefficients and add the exponents of like terms. So, $10x^2y^3 \cdot (10xy^8) = 10 \cdot 10 \cdot x^{2+1}y^{3+8} = 100x^3y^{11}$.

8. $\frac{24wz^2}{3w^3z^5}$

   **Solution:** For this expression, we simplify the coefficients by division and subtract the exponents of like terms (numerator - denominator). So, $\frac{24wz^2}{3w^3z^5} = \frac{24}{3} \cdot w^{1-3}z^{2-5} = 8w^{-2}z^{-3}$. This can also be written as $\frac{8}{w^2z^3}$ if you prefer not to have negative exponents.

9. $c^{\frac{2}{3}}$

   **Solution:** The expression $c^{\frac{2}{3}}$ can be rewritten in radical notation as $\sqrt[3]{c^2}$. This is because the denominator of the fraction in the exponent represents the root (in this case, the cube root), and the numerator represents the power (in this case, squared).

16. $x^{\frac{1}{6}}$

   **Solution:** Similarly, the expression $x^{\frac{1}{6}}$ can be rewritten in radical notation as $\sqrt[6]{x}$. Here, the denominator of the fraction in the exponent is 6, which represents the sixth root, and the numerator is 1, which represents the first power (or simply x).

17. $\sqrt{16x^{13}}$

   **Solution:** The square root of 16 is 4. For $x^{13}$, we can take out pairs of x's as $x^2$. There are 6 pairs and one x left inside the square root. So, $\sqrt{16x^{13}} = 4x^6\sqrt{x}$.

18. $\sqrt[3]{27a^6b^2}$

   **Solution:** The cube root of 27 is 3. For $a^6$, we can take out pairs of $a^3$ as there are 2 pairs. For $b^2$, there aren't enough b's to take out of the cube root, so it stays inside. So, $\sqrt[3]{27a^6b^2} = 3a^2\sqrt[3]{b^2}$.

19. $\sqrt{(3c)^9}$

   **Solution:** When taking the square root of a term raised to an odd power, we can take out half of the power (rounded down) and leave the rest inside the square root. The square root of $3^9$ is $3^4$ (since $4.5$ rounds down to $4$), and the square root of $c^9$ is $c^4\sqrt{c}$. So, $\sqrt{(3c)^9} = 3^4c^4\sqrt{3c} = 81c^4\sqrt{3c}$.

21. $\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{50} - 4\sqrt{8}$

   **Solution:** We can simplify each term first. $\sqrt{50}$ simplifies to $5\sqrt{2}$ and $\sqrt{8}$ simplifies to $2\sqrt{2}$. Substituting these simplifications back into the original expression gives us $\sqrt{2} + 5\sqrt{2} - 4*2\sqrt{2}$. Combining like terms, we find that the expression simplifies to $0$.

22. $4\left(2\sqrt{9} - 5\right)$

Solution: We can simplify inside the parentheses first. $2\sqrt{9}$ simplifies to $23 = 6$. Substituting this simplification back into the original expression gives us $4\left(6 - 5\right)$, which simplifies to $4(1) = 4$.

24. $(1+2\sqrt{7})(5 + \sqrt{7})$

**Solution:** We can use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method) to expand this expression.

First, we multiply the first terms in each binomial: $1 \cdot 5 = 5$.

Next, we multiply the outer terms: $1 \cdot \sqrt{7} = \sqrt{7}$.

Then, we multiply the inner terms: $2\sqrt{7} \cdot 5 = 10\sqrt{7}$.

Finally, we multiply the last terms: $2\sqrt{7} \cdot \sqrt{7} = 2 \cdot 7 = 14$.

Adding these results together, we get $5 + \sqrt{7} + 10\sqrt{7} + 14 = 19 + 11\sqrt{7}$.

27. Find the area of the triangle given the following characteristics: $b = 10x$, $h = 4x^2$, $A = \frac{1}{2}bh$

**Solution:** We can substitute the given values of $b$ and $h$ into the formula for the area of a triangle, which is $A = \frac{1}{2}bh$.

Substituting $b = 10x$ and $h = 4x^2$ into the formula gives us $A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 10x \cdot 4x^2 = 20x^3$.

So, the area of the triangle is $20x^3$ square units.

28. $\sqrt{-144}$

**Solution:** The square root of a negative number is an imaginary number. The square root of -144 is equal to the square root of 144 times the square root of -1. The square root of 144 is 12, and the square root of -1 is denoted as $i$. So, $\sqrt{-144} = 12i$.

29. $i^3$

**Solution:** The power of $i$ cycles every four powers: $i^1 = i$, $i^2 = -1$, $i^3 = -i$, $i^4 = 1$, $i^5 = i$, and so on. So, $i^3 = -i$. Therefore, $9i^3 = 9(-i) = -9i$.

30. $(6i - 8) + (-3i + 2)$

**Solution:** We can combine like terms to simplify this expression. $6i - 3i = 3i$ and $-8 + 2 = -6$. So, $(6i - 8) + (-3i + 2) = 3i - 6$, or $3(-2 + i)$ in standard form.

31. $4i(i+2)$

**Solution:** We can distribute $4i$ to both terms inside the parentheses: $4i \cdot i = 4i^2$ and $4i \cdot 2 = 8i$. Remember that $i^2 = -1$, so $4i^2 = 4(-1) = -4$. Therefore, $4i(i+2) = -4 + 8i$, or $4(-1 + 2i)$ in standard form.
